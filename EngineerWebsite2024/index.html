      <p>
        Greetings, My name is Anthony and welcome to my corner of the internet!
        I have a background in Electrical & Computer Engineering from North
        Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University (2020). <br />
        <br />
        If I could time travel to let my self in on what I am, and am planning
        on today, I would tell you, "you're crazy!", its been an interesting
        journey to be what I am today. <br /><br />
        I have interest & expertise any all electronic devices that transmit and
        recieve signals. I ensure communications from the circuit bit level, to
        large networks of databases and computers. A lot of the times I engage
        in high level process where we decompose and analyze the most neccesary
        steps to make room for others, while also considering redundancy and
        failures over time. <br />
        All in all, a complicated way to tell you, I like to solve problems!
        <br />
        <br />
        Enjoy your cruise through my experiences, which I hope motivate you to
        think big, and think of possibilities.
      </p>
      <br />
