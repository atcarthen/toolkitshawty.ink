        I spend countless hours of research, implementing & developing
        technologies on wide range of topics. I create solutions to sending and
        receiving electronic signals. <br />Creating this website, this is just
        one of the many skillsets I have uncovered. In 2024 I too, am one of the
        many who stand ready to take on the challenges of tomorrow, presenting
        new ideas. I possess the same meticulous work ethic that has advanced us
        this far. I have every intention to serve the public to the highest
        standard for consumption. I aim to educate and explore my constituency
        to find ways to consistently educate themselves, as we are life long
        learners. Ultimately, you can do anything you put your mind to! I train
        on my personal time on topics that include:

        As an engineer, I investigate new and old technologies that engage in
        the advancement of human civilization. Technologies I engage with, I
        want to simplify while implementing, conversely optimizing my own life
        to promote easy decision making.

        In my free time, you will find me coding applications to condense my
        life, or working on Hack The Box tutorials using my Parrot 5.3 Linux OS
        to explore. Outside of the house I get involved in University
        engineering initiatives with students to affect our countries best and
        brightest. Engaging with college/high school students, helps me directly
        get involved in how diverse solutions can be, making possiblity a
        reality!
